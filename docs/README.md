## Getting Started With Saihubot

## Developer

### Make a skill

Skill denotes rules and responses that the bot use to match and respond to the user.

Open browser's devtool and you can start to manipulate `Saihubot` object.
Skills are located in `Saihubot.responses`, and that is the place all you need to deal with.

Check [Skills Demo](https://gasolin.github.io/saihubot/samples/skill) for example.

### Make an addon

Addon denotes the extra function that can expand Saihubot's functionality.

You can extend Saihubot's functionality by import extra `saihubot-addon-[addonName].js`:

```js
const addonName = {
  name: 'name', // accessible via robot.addons.name
  requirements: {},
  action: (robot) => (normal, func) => {}, // need pass robot as first param.
};
```

then include the js file after `saihubot.js`.

```js
...
import Saihubot from 'saihubot'
import { addons } from 'saihubot-addon-[addonName]'
```

Check [Addon Demo](https://gasolin.github.io/saihubot/samples/addon) for example.
